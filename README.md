This project was built to brush up on my unit test and typescript skills.

I'm using a free [Cryptocurrency API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5734027/RzZ6Hzr3) to show some coin price data and increment this web app.

## Running

`yarn` to install dependencies

`yarn start` to run on development
